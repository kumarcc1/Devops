 Password authentication on Amazon EC2 images
Last Updated: 2021-03-09

You can allow password authentication on Amazon EC2 images.

Usually, Amazon Linux images have password and root login disabled by default. Amazon AWS EC2 recommends to use SSH keys to access the images. The images are usually also sudo enabled.
You can enable password and root login using the following procedure:
Update the cloud-init configuration file to allow root access and password login.
Update the authorized_keys file.
Update the sshd_config file to enable password authentication and root login.
Note: Future Amazon updates to the images might require changes to the procedure.
Update the cloud-init configuration file
Make sure that the following lines are in the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file:
disable_root: false
ssh_pwauth:   true

These properties enable root login and password authentication in cloud-init. They are required to set the password via user-data.
Update the authorized_keys file
In the authorized_keys file, remove the command prefix and leave only the ssh-rsa statement. For example, change the following default content:
no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,command="echo 'Please login 
as the user \"ec2-user\" rather than the user \"root\".';echo;sleep 10" 
ssh-rsa <content of sshkey>

to the following content:
ssh-rsa <content of sshkey>

Update the sshd_config file
Log on to the Amazon EC2 image by using SSH and complete the following steps:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
Update the following lines:
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes

Save the file.
Run the following command:
sudo service sshd restart

From the target slave node's console

Switch to the root user:
sudo su
Add a jenkins user with the home /var/lib/jenkins (Note: I am keeping my home directory in /var/lib/jenkins):
useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins
From the Jenkins Master

Copy the /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key from the Jenkins user on the master

From the target slave node's console

Create an authorized_keys file for the Jenkins user
mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
touch /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
Paste the key from the Jenkins master into the file vim. Save with :wq!

Make sure the files have correct owner and permission.
chown -R jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
chmod 600 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
